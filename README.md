# osu2007-server
Private Server Software for osu! b99.

Supports:
- User Accounts
- Leaderboards and Ranked beatmaps
- Score Submission
- Replay viewing
- User profiles (Belmod only)
- Chat (Belmod only)

Beatmap ranking will be heavily reliant on our Discord server, which will be made in the coming weeks.

**We will not support newer versions.** Updates will be made to a private Belmod branch.
